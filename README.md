# Machine-learning-using-R
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the analysis and model  building process of machine learning tools and techniques
This directory contains database concerning heart diseases diagnoses 
all attributes are numeric values. We have used processed Cleveland 
dataset with 303 instances. The Cleveland dataset has following 
features:
Attributes Information
1. Age
2. Sex
3. CP
4. TrestBPS
5. Chol
6. Fbs
7. RestECG
8. Thalach
9. Exang
10. Oldpeak
11. Slope
12. Ca
13. Thal
14. Num
In Real life there are dozens of important parameters needed to measure 
the probability if there is Heart disease, but we are dealing pre-stated 
above 14 attributes.
